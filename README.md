# Face-Attendance-System-using-Machine-Learning
I developed a Face Attendance System using machine learning and Python as the core programming language. The system uses OpenCV and Mediapipe for real-time face detection and recognition, with NumPy for facial data processing. The project is built with a Flask backend and a responsive frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
